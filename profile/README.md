# Metric Provenance 🇪🇺

### The Reference Implementation for the Open Data Governance Standard (ODGS)

**Metric Provenance** maintains the open protocols required to secure **High-Risk AI** under the EU AI Act (Article 10). We provide the cryptographic "Binding Layer" that ensures AI agents rely on verified, deterministic definitions—not probabilistic hallucinations.

## 🏛️ The Mission: Sovereign AI Compliance

The **EU AI Act (Article 10)** mandates that data used in High-Risk AI systems must be *"relevant, representative, and error-free."*

Current data stacks (Data Lakes/Vector DBs) manage **Data Lineage** (Origin) but fail to enforce **Semantic Integrity** (Meaning). This creates a "Liability Gap" where AI agents can execute decisions based on obsolete or undefined business logic.

**Metric Provenance closes this gap.**
We treat "Governance" not as documentation, but as a **Cryptographic Dependency**.

## 📂 The Standard: ODGS

Our core contribution is the **Open Data Governance Standard (ODGS)**—a vendor-neutral protocol for **Semantic Hashing**.

### 📦 [odgs-core](https://github.com/MetricProvenance/odgs-core)
*The Apache 2.0 Reference Implementation for Article 10 Data Binding.*

**Technical Capabilities:**
- **Semantic Hashing:** Generates a SHA-256 hash of the business definition (logic + rules).
- **Runtime Enforcement:** Forces AI Agents to "cite" the valid hash before inference.
- **Audit Trails:** Provides a deterministic log of *what* the AI thought a metric meant at the moment of execution.

## 🇪🇺 Regulatory Alignment

This project is developed in alignment with the upcoming technical mandates for High-Risk AI.

* **Standardization:** Contributing member to **NEN / ISO JTC 25** (Data Quality & AI).
* **License:** All Core Protocols are open-source (**Apache 2.0**) to ensure European Strategic Autonomy and prevent vendor lock-in.
